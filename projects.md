			As a computer science major, I've always been interested in exploring various fields. Here is a showcase of those projects.

			<h2>T∆G</h2>

		<p>
			This semester, I took a class called Idea-to-Prototype (I2P), a class founded by Georgia Tech's Create-X program. For this course, I was to find teammates and bring to the course a startup idea that we could potentially build. My team's idea was to create a item-tracker to make sure items wouldn't be lost, no matter where they were in the world.
			<br/><br/>
			In order to do this, the app uses GNSS (the open-source equivalent of GPS) to first detect the general location of the item-tracker, or the T∆G as my team called it. After getting close enough to the device, the app uses Bluetooth, WiFi, and ultrasonic technologies to specifically find the device and get a general "hot-cold" measure of the user's distance from the item-tracker.
			<br/><br/>
			From this project, I learned a lot about radio frequency technologies, sockets, and mobile application development, as well as the specific tools I used to implement the application. Developing the app was a bit frustrating at times due to the app getting locked out from calling Google's Nearby Messages API too many times (oops), but I'd say I had fun making this.

			<h2>Hackathon Projects</h2>

		<p>Quite a bit of my freshman year of college was spent on going to hackathons, and through those experiences I've learned quite a bit about website development, data science, and more importantly, how to learn quickly. Check out the projects:</p>
