			<h2>T∆G</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			In my second semester at Georgia Tech, I took a class called Idea-to-Prototype (I2P), a class founded by Georgia Tech's Create-X program. For this course, I was to find teammates and bring to the course a startup idea that we could potentially build. My team's idea was to create a item-tracker to make sure items wouldn't be lost, no matter where they were in the world.
			<br/><br/>
			In order to do this, the app uses GNSS (the open-source equivalent of GPS) to first detect the general location of the item-tracker, or the T∆G as my team called it. After getting close enough to the device, the app uses Bluetooth, WiFi, and ultrasonic technologies to specifically find the device and get a general "hot-cold" measure of the user's distance from the item-tracker.
			<br/><br/>
			From this project, I learned a lot about radio frequency technologies, sockets, and mobile application development, as well as the specific tools I used to implement the application. Developing the app was a bit frustrating at times due to the app getting locked out from calling Google's Nearby Messages API too many times (oops), but I'd say I had fun making this.

			Ever since I seriously picked up computer science as a junior in high school, I've never put it down. Computer science seems to be an ever expanding field with seemingly infinite possibilities, so I like taking some free time to use (and break) these tools. Starting out with the fundamentals, I've learned about data structure and algorithms, website and mobile applications development, data science, artificial intelligence (AI) -- specifically AI, and applications of all of those techniques. Who knows what I might discover in the future? Anyway. Here is a showcase of those projects.

			<h2>Hackathon Projects</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Quite a bit of my freshman year of college was spent on going to hackathons, and through those experiences I've learned quite a bit about website development, data science, and more importantly, how to learn quickly. Check out the projects:</p>
