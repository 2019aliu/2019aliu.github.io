Photos of me taken by my close friend, Antonio Martin. These were taken in the Summer of 2019.

In the summer of 2019, a good friend, Antonio Martin, and I went out to explore D.C. metropolitan area a few times. Each time, we took some photos and then went out to eat somewhere before exploring the area a bit more. Both of us enjoyed the trips, whether it was playing around with the lighting or crashing a furniture store's final operating hours. 

Antonio got to play with different settings on his cameras, which I don't fully understand to this day. From my perspective, he was manipulating the camera to get a closer or further shot and capture an appropriate amount of light, depending on the scene. I'm also kind of ignorant sometimes, so that probably explains why I wasn't quite sure what was happening.

As someone who didn't initially like getting photos taken, I now enjoy taking photos whenever I'm up for it of course -- getting your photo taken when you're not confident doesn't give good results. At first, I really wasn't good at it, but with each successive photo, I got better at getting out a genuine smile. I can't say I'm perfect, but I can say I've gotten a lot better at it. Looking back on it, these photos helped me figure out how to smile and, more importantly, provided me a boost of confidence in my appearance.

Good times.
