## Background

Since I was a little kid, I've been playing the piano. After watching a family friend play the piano, I decided, "I want to do that too!" My parents helped me sign up for piano lessons, and that begin my journey world of piano.

In elementary school, I was classically trained in piano with a teacher named Greg Genter ("Mr. Greg", as I'd call him as a little kid). He taught me the fundamentals of playing piano, including scales, arpeggios, finger exercises, and theory. I was going pretty slow at first and all of the classical pieces he asked me to play seemed the same, but the philosophy is that repeated perfect practice makes perfect, right? Along the way, I performed music for his annual recitals when he got a large studio, performed for charity occasionally, and even got a recording on YouTube -- no, I don't know where the link is, but it's on YouTube somewhere.

Starting middle school, I was expecting to take more lessons with Greg, but then Greg hit me with a sad truth.

"Alex", he said, "I love teaching you but I gotta teach other people too, and you're ability surpasses the limit at which I can teach you meaningfully. For the sake of both of us, find yourself a new teacher".

It wasn't totally unexpected; Greg was making a bunch of mistakes in some of the demos of the songs I was playing and he was losing a lot of time to stay with his family because he was buliding a business called [The Piano Express](https://thepianoexpress.com). No matter, it still hit me like a brick. Greg gave me a list of teachers he recommended. However, none of the teachers I contacted resonated with me as well as Greg did. Thinking back on it, maybe I should paid more attention... but that's another story. I just felt like there was no teacher that could teach me anything. It also didn't help that I was constantly distracted and given that I'd picked up clarinet in the 4th Grade and was going to participate in middle school band, I stopped taking piano lessons.

Nonetheless, I still kept playing piano in my free time, whenever I wasn't playing games or something. One of my only posts on my facebook is a cover of Fantasie-Impromptu, written by the legend himself Frédéric Chopin. It was something I wanted to get off my shoulders and also Greg had challenged me to learn it. Because I wanted to get the video out before my birthday, I cut out the jumping octaves in the right hand. Even so, I still had a bit of difficulty getting the 3-on-4 polyrhythm correct. Apparently, the thumbs play notes at the same time in the first few measures, and I used that to get the rhythm correct. The rest of the fast portions were also a bit difficult because of the fast paced sixteenth notes in the right hand, but it all worked out at the end I guess.

In high school, I started picking up a few songs because some other kids I hung out with started playing songs from Japanese animes. We all started getting sheet music from a YouTuber named Animenz, and we started competing against each other to see who could learn things the fastest. While I was never at the front of the pack, I still had a lot of fun playing these pieces, and it brought us together through the sometimes challenging curriculum we had in school.

College was a better time for me to explore piano, because I had more time on my hands. Albeit, there was more to be done, but I had more flexibility, so I could sit down in front of the keyboard in my floor's lounge for hours at a time and play. The kids living next to the lounge could probably tell you to the numerous times I've practiced a difficult part from Blue Bird (3rd opening from Naruto Shippuden), or heard the Nintendo Mii theme at 100% volume while trying to study. Oh well.
