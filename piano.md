One of my hobbies is playing music. Currently, I play a variety of music, including anime, jazz, classical, and popular.

(History of me playing piano) Since I was a little kid, I've been playing the piano. (Something about me taking lessons) (Something about Animenz here) (Something about GT PianoForte)

## Recordings

### Hikaru Nara - Goose House

VIDEO HERE

Hikaru Nara is a song by Goose House, a Japanese pop band. (Insert what the song means here lmao). Japnese anime fans might recognize this song, as it was used as the opening theme for the popular anime series Your Lie in April (known in Japan as Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso or just simply Kimiuso). I enjoy watching anime, but I first heard this song covered on the piano by Animenz, and decided to learn his transcription of the piece. 

This interpretation of Hikaru Nara is more like a ballad.

### Blue Bird - Ikimono-Gakari
