			<h2>Selected Hacks</h2>
		</header>
		<p>I went to my first hackathon toward the end of my sophomore year in high school. Since then, especially in college, I enjoy going to hackathons to exercise my learning capabilities and creativity. In the process, I've learned a lot about website development and general applications development, as well as utilizing different combinations of APIs to produce creative solutions, or "hacks", within limited time to pressing problems.<br/><br/>Here are a few of my favorite and best hacks. Hope you enjoy!</p>
