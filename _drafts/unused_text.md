A couple of notes:

When I initially decided I wanted a completely different website from my first website (which was the one I made in my senior year of high school),

Haven't gotten a chance to get pictures taken by the wonderful Antonio Martin in a while, but this section displays that. The gallery in there doesn't work, so now my photos are way too big.
