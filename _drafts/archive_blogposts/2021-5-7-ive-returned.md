Well well well.

## What's happened to me

To say that this past year has been rough is quite an understatement. It's not because of some crazy events like a fire happening or some hurricane hitting the house, but rather the lack of things I did this past year. While I try to shrug it off and keep it cool with people, sometimes I just can't help but think to myself, I could've still been fit, or I could've been a much better person and met a lot more people i everything was in person. But excuses are excuses, after all.

<!-- more -->

A high-level list of what has happened to me:

- I started playing a LOT of video games, specifically one game: Valorant. This shit is addictive (I mean it's a really good game, you should get into it too /s).
- I stopped playing piano. Big L. It's mainly because I dumped all of the time I would be playing piano into playing Valorant, and I only have so much time in a day, right?
- I stopped exercising in the morning and just intense exercise in general. Out of everything, I hate myself the most for this, because now I don't even have a fucking 2 pack or a 4 pack, let alone a 6 pack, and I'm pretty sure I've gained thirty pounds of fat and lost ten pounds of muscle. Fuck me man.
- I didn't talk to teachers like I thought I would. Again, I want to make an excuse that "oh, being in person is so much better" but in reality I probably spent the time I would be learning or talking to teachers and other people to go play a video game because I thought I could hit the professional level or some stupid conjured fantasy.
- And last but certainly not least, I gained 25 pounds. Holy shit. I'm now 200 pounds and fucking overweight.

As you can tell, my life is an absolute disaster. This is not how I want my life to be.

If it helps, here are some things that went well:

- In the fall last year I decided to PM a project. Didn't really take off but I think my client got a good design, so what the heck that's not terrible
- Over winter break, I decided to look into some stocks and it was quite interesting, so I picked up a fintech project this past semester

## What needs to happen now

There's quite a few things I want to do with my life at the moment (a lot of things really) and as much as I'd like to believe it, going pro in Valorant is probably not one of them. Here's what needs to happen this summer:

- Internship: I'm interning with NCR this summer, and because this is my main thing (I mean I'm doing this 40 hours a week at least), I gotta nail it
- FinTech research: FinTech is something I've wanted to get into but just feel like I don't really understand. I'll probably talk to Dr. Chava and Agam about this and see what they think about me working on the project over the summer. I'm thinking I can commit like 5 hours a week to it.
- Grad school / Jobs: So I"m graduating from GT as an undergrad next year, and I have to apply to grad school. That means I have to think about:
  - Writing personal statements and answering questions
  - Writing letters of recommendations for myself (wtf do I even write about)
  - Taking the GRE. I am not happy about this because this requires extra preparation and I hate taking exams so this is not gonna be fun.
- Piano: for the longest time I've wanted to start putting out some clips of me playing piano and it kind of went sideways. I want to learn a few pieces, probably jazz and classical and maybe something from an anime, that are decently challenging and good enough to put up on a Youtube channel.

## How I'm gonna do it

I have no idea, really. This one's gonna be tough because I want to do intense exercise two times a day five or six times a week but that's gonna burn me out. The plan is something like this:

- I wanna get back into morning gym, and I mean like 5 in the morning, 2 hours of gym. Unfortunately, the pool doesn't open until 6:30 in the morning, so what I'll probably do is go for a half hour run/row and then 75-90 minute swim or some shit like that
- After that I head back home make breakfast blah blah blah, maybe I take a nap, then I gotta do real shit. Obviously I gotta do my internship which is 9-5:30 I'm assuming (discounting lunch hour)
- I do want to bike a bit after work so I'll do that
- Then I gotta work on my personal projects
- Prep for the GRE
- Write something in this blog

And that's a weekday. Weekends are a bit different, mainly because I'm not sure what to expect out of my internship and whether I need to do anything over the weekend (let's be honest I'm probably gonna need to at the end). Ideally, I'd be prepping for the GRE and doing my side project and playing the piano, but I might fall back to gaming more, I don't even know.

Life is hard, man. We'll see.
