Today I practiced some piano. It was a lot less focused than when I usually practice (my brother interrupted a lot of it o_O) but I practiced Clair de Lune. That piece is coming along pretty well, and I feel like with a week's worth of consistent practice, I think I have it in the bag in terms of recording a good take. It's really repetitive, and the only hard part is the part that isn't repetitive -- I think I'm playing it incorrectly but I'll have to check.

I also realized that the songs "Don't Mean a Thing" by Duke Ellington Cover and "Friend Like Me" from Aladdin share quite some similarities, including the primary keys used to play the song and a lot of the patterns used. For very scientific validation, I found a top YouTube comment from Sheet Music Boss's transcription of Don't Mean a Thing that says the same thing. Here's both of the videos for reference:

- "Don't Mean a Thing" by Duke Ellington

I think this cover is better. If the link breaks, the cover is the last song in the video

- "Friend Like Me" from Aladdin

Again, I think a human cover is better for evaluating a song. Here is one by Kristen Mosca, a *really* good ragtime pianist

I'm thinking about covering both of these songs in a short cover, and I think it'll be a lot of fun.
