My status, May 26th, 2020.

<!-- more -->

Last night, before I drifted off to bed, I had a few thoughts, but before that, I wanted to do a status check.

Today (May 25, 2020) wasn't the best of days, and it's because I realized how irresponsible I am and it's been bothering me. The day started off pretty well, but then degraded into a shit show. My portfolio lost more than 5% of its value (I have 1 share of NFLX, 1 share of FB, and 3 shares of MRNA if y'all are curious), but that's not the worst of it (or at least in my mind). I got my payment last Friday, and I thought that the payment wasn't the full 20 an hour I was promised for the contract. It turns out Social Security and Income Tax and Medicare Tax apply to me? I'm 18 year old and my pay rate shouldn't have been taxed hello? I'm gonna talk to HR about this. And then I kinda got ghosted by a few people sot that could only make my day worse, right? And then I missed one of my close friend's calls, and haven't even called anyone recently aaaaaaaaa. And then I also haven't read books in a long ass time, and ... I need to sort everything out.
