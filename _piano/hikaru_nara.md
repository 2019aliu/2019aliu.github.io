Hikaru Nara (光るなら) is a song by Goose House, a Japanese pop band. The title translates to "If It Shines", and is about someone finding the love of their life and hoping to reach them. Japanese anime fans might recognize this song, as it was used as the opening theme for the popular anime series Your Lie in April (also known as Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, (‎四月は君の嘘)).

While I enjoy watching anime and listen to the opening tracks, the reason I wanted to play this song was because of YouTuber Animenz's transcription. After listening to this for a few times, I printed the sheet music and got to work.

Animenz's interpretation of Hikaru Nara is more like a ballad, as he said in his video. In fact, the first verse doesn't start until around a minute into the song, at the first fermata. Also, the pace of Animenz's transcription is slower than the original song but a few beats per minute and the choruses are played more dramatically. It's interesting to see an upbeat song turned into a dramatic piece. I did try to make Animenz's version a bit more exciting, but that only resulted in weird timings and notes and, more importantly, threw my tempo out of window, so I just stuck to the original version.

There were a few things I would have liked to improve on, such as the tempo of the song and cleaning up the left hand part. I've always had trouble with timing and with this piece there was no exception, especially in the first verse of the song. The same goes for the left hand; listening carefully to the chorus, you'll probably hear one mistake, two mistakes, or a lot more than that. It's kind of a smack in the face for not taking the fundamentals like sacles and arpeggios seriously, welp.

One last thing: I wanted to cover this in April because this piece was used in Your Lie in April, but didn't record fast enough I guess. Maybe that's the lie in the title: that the lie wasn't actually in April? I don't know what I'm saying.

Well, hope you enjoy this cover!
