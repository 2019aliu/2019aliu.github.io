I finally finished recording my first video for the piano page (of hopefully many)! My god that was kinda painful.

I learned this piece a while back (in the middle of the semester), performed it at a recital, and then put it away until now. Alongside Blue Bird (which I learned at the **start** of the semester and **still** haven't recorded ughhhhhhhh), I never thought I was going to record some piano until I started building this website and thought about the purpose of it: to showcase my abilities in multiple disciplines. Maybe I feel like I have a point to prove to someone or something, but whatever it is it's driving me a bit crazy.

Anyway, after almost 100 takes (or at least it felt like that if not more), I am proud to post my first video! It is a video of my cover of Hikaru Nara, the opening theme from Your Lie In April and written by Japanese pop band Goose House.

You can find it here: [Hikaru Nara]({{site.baseurl}}{{site.piano.hikaru_nara.url}})

I actually never had the intention of learning this piece during the semester before PianoForte announced (or more like when I heard about) their inaugural recital. I wanted to be part of the first iteration of something which I thought could become something pretty big. As a college student who doesn't know what he's doing, I signed up without thinking too much, but then I realized: I had a month left, and the piece I was currently working on, Blue Bird, was nowhere near ready. I needed a piece that sounded good and was easy to perform. Maybe it was because the show I discovered it on was about piano playing, maybe because I thought it was easy at first, or maybe I was just insane I have no clue, but I ended up choosing to cover Hikaru Nara on piano, using YouTuber Animenz's cover.

Picking up the general melody and harmony was surprisingly simple, but when I threw in all of the details that Animenz had added, being the fancy music student he was -- imagine having that much commitment to this jesus christ -- it became a bit difficult. Come show time, I still haven't polished all of the details. When I performed, I may have just masked all of the mistakes with a dOmInAtInG right hand so no one could hear my left hand woes.

Hope you enjoy the cover! Fill the form down below if you would like to suggest me to cover a song you like.
