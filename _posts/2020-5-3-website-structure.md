I'm writing this in a separate post because I wanted to test out the chronological sorting on this website, but it looks like it works, yay! (I also fell asleep writing this, oh well)

The purpose of this website isn't just going to be for employers to see my accomplishments. This is going to be a portfolio of some sort as well, because I want to showcase my cool work. <!-- more --> Up until now, I've always seen other people post their achievements, whether it would be art or music or programs or anything else. I thought to myself, I want to do that too! And so here I am with this static site generator, Jekyll, and my thoughts.

This website will have several components and is laid out in the navigation menu in the top right:

- **Blog**: This is what you're reading right now! I plan to use this section as a social media of sorts, giving updates on everything related to this site and anything else that happens in my life. You can find out more about why I chose to have this blog in [this post]({% post_url 2020-5-3-blog-inspiration %}).
- **Projects**: I love building cool software and I'm also a Computer Science undergraduate at the Georgia Institute of Technology at the time of writing. Any project which I either think I put some effort or was really cool will go here. This is linked to the hackathons page.
  - **Hackathons**: This subsection contains my work done during hackathons. My [Devpost](https://devpost.com/2019aliu) describes the projects into a little more detail, which I link for each featured project in this section.
- **Photography**:  Photos of me, places I've been, good food, and anything else I think is cool.
- **Piano**: Playing the piano. It's been a longtime hobby of mine. I play a variety of music, including classical, jazz, and anime. There will be three sections.
  - Pieces I'm learning will be listed under __Learning__.
  - Pieces I'm in the process of getting a good recording will be listed under __Recording__.
  - Pieces I've finished recording and am ready to present will be listed under __Finished__ (or I might not have a title for this section, it will appear first).
- **Resume**: This section is dedicated to my resume. Each version of my resume is linked to a file on GitHub, which is updated everytime I make edits to my Resume (assuming I remember to run the script I wrote to generate PDFs for the Resume)

This may be edited depending on where my interests lie going forward, but this is how I envision my website will be for now.

A few things that bother me:

- I don't know how to pull images from Google PHotos and make it into a gallery. The plugin doesn't seem to fly with GitHub Pages
- Not so sure if I want to upload videos to YouTube or just upload them to Google Drive with the [jekyll-embed-video plugin](https://github.com/nathancy/jekyll-embed-video#embed-google-drive) (assuming it actually works with GitHub Pages, might have to look at that). Or, I could put instagram posts in the webpage, which doesn't look to be terribly hard as described [here](https://millarian.com/code/adding-an-instagram-feed-to-jekyll/).

I'm also thinking about adding tags and categories. From what I'm reading, categories are general topics of the post, whereas tags are specific details about the post that should be easy to search for. So many things to do aaaaaaaaaaaa.

That's about it for now. If I think of someting cool, I'll write it down.

As always, if you have questions, feel free to submit questions down below.
