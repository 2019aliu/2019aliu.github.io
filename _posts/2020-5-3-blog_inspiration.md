I'm not sure why this is a post and not in the [Website Structure post]({% post_url 2020-5-3-website_structure %}). Anyway.

Many times, I've had thoughts about the different aspects of life that I never get to write down. Whether I'd be in bed, in the shower, walking somewhere, riding a bus/car/train/you name it, or taking a break from something intense, when all of a sudden, I have an inspirational thought that I wish I could just record directly from my brain. See, the ideal solution would to just stick some metal (idk an electroencephalogram (EEG) or better than that) and just be able to listen to the thoughts in your head. But that would cause a lot of legal issues and that's no fun. So for now, we're stuck with plain old writing.

At first, I wrote everything on notepads, but none of them really sustained for a long period of time. Maybe I couldn't maintain the notepads for a long time because I need a light to see what I'm writing. Maybe I couldn't maintain the notepads for a long time because I held myself to writing on the notepad everyday (that would be a me problem, oops).

Thoughts are ephemeral: once they leave the brain in the short time that they last, they're pretty much gone, unless you can remember what you were thinking, and that's very hard and not worth the time. This has to do with the brain not being able to store many things in the hippocampus (brain part for short-term memory) compared to the numerous brain regions for storing long-term memories (e.g. amygdala, olfactory system, prefrontal cortex).

Some other reasons why I started this blog:

- I'm also pretty bad at writing and reading stuff. In other words, I can't English. Language arts has never been my forte, as I like to think logically, and if something doesn't follow logically, I don't like it. Numerous teachers have said that I've had great ideas but can't express myself well, so I guess this is a grounds for me to practice as well.
- Also, I don't post often on social media (if at all oops), so hopefully I can use this as a sort of social media to keep people posted if people are going to check this.

As for how long this will last, I cannot be certain, but at least I've laid the foundation.
