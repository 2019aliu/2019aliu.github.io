We live in strange times. That can only call for good planning to straighten out the activities I want to engage in.

I've been involved primarily with software development to hone my technical skills for interviews in the fall. My internship this summer luckily did not get canceled (yay!), so I've been busy with that for four weeks now (I started on May 11th).

<!-- more -->

Besides that, now as a member of the Developer Student Club, I'm now responsible for a project about managing the recycling facilities in Georgia Tech. Why did I do this to myself? I'm not sure, maybe I have brain damage maybe I don't and am just really stupid (that was a joke by the way).

Oh yeah I also agreed to tutor someone on JS and react-native. Why why why why why.

But that's all kinda like business-related projects I guess, because there are other side projects that I want to pursue. For example, I thought it would be wonderful to write an AI to play Hearts against my roommates and I. Every night on Friday (whether we're away or not), we play games. It started out as poker before I joined the group, and went to Avalon, Catan, Krunker (a free FPS online) and now Hearts, a trick-taking card game whose objective is to take the least number of points.

Oh yeah, did I mention I also want to learn how to invest and eventually write an AI that does day trading? Yeah, one of my friends, Antonio Martin, also invests, and we want to make that day trading AI, or maybe an AI that detects anomalies or something (I have to follow up on him for that)

Is all of this worth it? I don't think so. By no means am I saying software development is boring or detrimental to my health, but as every day passes by, I feel the need to read and write more (which is part of the reason why I'm writing this blog). Technical skills are cool, but knowing about how to read and write allows you to understand more abstract concepts, such as morals, ethics, and leadership. There's a reason leaders don't need to be the most knowledgeable in a field to be lead well.

This is so underrated, especially in the schools that I have attended, including Georgia Tech (GT). I will give it to Georgia Tech that it is a technical institute and not a typical college in terms of curriculum. We yellowjackets learn whats used in industry to build things, and that's important, but that's not enough.
