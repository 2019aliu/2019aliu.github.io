					<h3>Projects</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Here, you'll find most of my publicly available projects, including my long-term projects and hackathon work. Computer science is an ever expanding field with seemingly infinite possibilities, so I like taking some free time to use (and break) these tools. I discovered computer science in high school, and never put it down since.</p>

					<h3>Piano</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Playing music is fun! All of the covers and compositions I've recorded, as well as the pieces I'm currently practicing, are here. Currently, I play a variety of music including anime, jazz, classical, and popular. Since I was a little kid, I've been playing the piano, and my love for music has only grown from there. </p>

					<h3>Photography</h3>
				</header>
				<p>This section has photos of me and photos taken by me. While visiting my grandparents, my grandpa gave me a book on photography and I found it to be quite interesting. Standing in front of the camera was a bit more challenging for me, but eventually I got the hang of it. </p>
